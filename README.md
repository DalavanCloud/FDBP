Font Development Best Practice documentation

General Info
- Each page is written in GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and begins with Jekyll front matter which specifies the title, category, weight (page sort order), published status, and layout (page template - bookpage is currently used by all pages).
- The GFM pages are in the en-US folder.
- The current pages are all placeholders which need to be filled out.

To contribute, edit the GitHub Flavored Markdown pages in the en-US folder.
This can be done several ways:
- Clone the repo, then edit the files with a text editor and push them.
- Use the GitHub web editor.
- Use [prose.io/#silnrsi/FDBP](http://prose.io/#silnrsi/FDBP), which provides a GUI-like interface for GFM.
You will need to use the prose.io interface to add that service as an authorized app on your GitHub account.

A page can be added by adding a file to the en-US directory.
- Do not use spaces in the file name.
- Copy the front matter (between the triple hyphens) from another file and update the
weight, title, and possibly category.
- New pages will generally use a category that’s already in use.
- Add the page title and weight to en-US-weightlist.md.

If you contribute, add your name to AUTHORS.txt. The structure Victor indicated can be found
at the bottom of this Google [Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0K-oYRw6ZqHvM1TT2k0_CkQuv-pJqvRQgQXNUb02IA/edit#heading=h.zhldii2y6sjb). New pages probably aren’t needed for topics below the top level -- at least not until a placeholder page gets too full.
