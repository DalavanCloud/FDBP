title: Background Knowledge

The discussions in the following chapters assume a certain amount of background knowledge.
Some of this depends on the specific subject.
For example, a font designer who is creating character glyphs needs to know different things than a script engineer who is constructing OpenType tables.

We try to provide references to documents that will provide you with this background information.
If you find that we've assumed some knowledge that made the discussion confusing, we invite you to let us know and we'll try to provide more information.
