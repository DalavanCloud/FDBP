This section will contain information on creating composite glyphs.

Composite glyphs are composed of one or more other glyphs, rather than having contours to define their shape. For example, the glyph for a vowel with an acute accent can be composed of the glyph for the base vowel plus the glyph for the acute accent, rather than repeating the contour information for the base vowel and the acute accent.

One format for describing composites uses a single line to define the resulting glyph as a combination of other glyphs. The tool described in [Composite Tools](Composite_Tools.html) uses this format.
