This book has been produced to document what we think are the best practices to use in font development. They are generally the practices we use - or intend on using as soon as practically possible.

This is not intended to be a comprehensive encyclopedia of information, nor to cover the full range of techniques and options. It will generally offer a single recommended procedure, setting, or tool. However we encourage adding links to alternatives when appropriate.

It is very much a work in progress. If you wish to help us, you can contribute to this documentation [on GitHub].
See README.md for contribution instructions.
